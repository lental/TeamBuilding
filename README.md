# TeamBuilding
My personal thoughts on team building and management

--------

This repo is meant to encapsulate some of my opinions on building an engineering team, and engineering management.

I hope that over the lifetime of this repo, I can see the growth of my perspective, and determine what i've learned through my career.

My opinions are of course not absolute, and I do not intend to declare what is good and bad.  I'm only trying to reflect, and express how I view people, teams, and organizations.
