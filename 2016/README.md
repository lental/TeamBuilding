All things considered, I have a fairly small worldview of what an engineering team should be.  

I've been out of college for only 4 years, where I have been at Ooyala for the entire duration.  While the team has changed, I've been part of the same team from the start. This limited perspective has put strong bias on my experiences, but I hope that I can share some perspective on teams and management that can be applied generally.

Not everything here is fully cleaned up, but there are points in here that I firmly believe in.

# Skills for good management

## Strong mediation

Being able to objectively handle all sides of a problem and show impartialness is important for your opinions to be taken seriously.

During debates, always pinpoint valid opposing arguments, and provide your counterpoints if any. They key point is expressly stating that their point is a valid one. Doing this before you provide counterpoints makes it clear that they are progressing the conversation positively.

## Always give credit

Any time, even if its only the slightest reference to something someone else said, acknowledge their contributions. It's always better to lean on the side of credit, instead of potentially making someone feel like their contribution was taken away.

## Don't micromanage - Let your teammates make decisions, and let them fully experience the outcomes

One of my personal flaws is that I feel like I know how to explain things in the clearest fashion.  When someone on my team explains something in less detail than I would have liked (for example, in an email, or a ticket, or during a meeting), I tend to speak up and provide more detail, hoping to clarify the situation for others.  Doing this has made my team members feel like they were being corrected publicly, which while that was not my intention, I can definitely acknowledge.  Being able to let other people ask questions, or asking quesitons myself to the team would give that person a better chance to provide detail themselves, as opposed to me taking over.

## Be able to summarize everything

Be able to explain things at multiple different levels.  From the mile-high, to brass-tacks. Each audience will need a different level of explanation - You don't want to be providing too much information for someone who doesn't care, and you don't want to gloss over details for someone who needs them.

## Be able to lead meetings
 
When conversations get confusing, or meetings get off track, be able to reset the conversation to a known neutral point. 

## Be approachble

### Provide very specific, pointed compliments

Actively express your positive opinions whenever you have them - 
  If you see a line of code that impressed you, tell them!
  If you thought someone's explanation was very clear, tell them!

Be very observant - Haircuts are the easiest. Acknowledge when someone cuts their hair, or if someone does their hair differently.  

For some, you can acknlowedge if you like their particular outfit, or if you can go as far and acknowlege if someone got new clothes.

Of course, understand people's boundries. some people may be more reserved than others.  

If you get into a very deep conversation with someone, thank them for their time, and express how nice it is to talk to them as such. It closes these types of conversations off nicely, and makes everyone feel good at the end.

# What has made me stand out

## An outgoing personality
## An overall positive perspective of any situation

The ability to be enthusiastic, especially when times are not always rosy.  You do need to stay honest and not sugar-coat everything, but you need to make sure people focus on the positives.

## A clear willingness to help others

Clearly expressing the willingness to stop and answer any questions with the team. Many people will err on the side of "not bothering you".  If you express the openness to help, it will help some people's decision-making.

Clearly express the desire to work directly with customers.

## The ability to diffuse tense situations

* I go into a call with the attitude of helping answer any question a customer has
* Listen to all of their issues before starting any conversation
* Taking live notes, showing them on the screen, providng responses directly in the notes while talking, and distributing those notes after the fact
* Always be able to acknlowedge their frustrations, reassure them that their observations are important, and provide resolutions when possible

## Making an honest effort to know every single person

Sub-skills - Not feeling awkward asking someone their name, even if you were supposed to know it
Introducing yourself to people on other teams, letting yourself be known as a contact for your team

## Ability to maintain casual conversation

## Willingness to make myself known on all levels of the organization

Running cross-organization meetings
Participating in cross-org groups

## Organized company-wide groups

Gaming, Movie Night, Game Night, Weekend hangouts. Having a willingness to advocate and spend time to plan or schedule these events.

## Ability to give unfavorable/blunt opinions in a diffusing way, while providing adequate explanation

A lot of the times its not good to beat around the bush.  Sometimes you need to be able to take your opinion, let it be known early, and provide all of your reasoning for your opinion

## Strong mentorship skills

## Always did work above my job title

The saying goes, when you're promoted, you're usually already doing the job of your new role. The best way to show that you deserve a higher level in a team is to contribute at that level.

* As a SWE2 (project contributor), I would do what I can to show I can architect my project and future projects.
* As a SWE3 (project lead), I would show I can understand and guide the entire product's direction.
* As a SWE4 (team lead), I would show I can contribute on an organization's level.

## Huge project management nerd


## Willing to knowledge share

A great way to build repertoire within a team or organization is to present knowledge that you have, that others may not have. 

## Presentation skills

* The ability to generate crisp presentations, with a full beginning/middle/end narrative
* Clear goals for the presentation, callbacks to those original goals
* Well practiced, metered speaking and timing

## Ability to understand entire product space


## Be willing to acknowledge the bigger picture

Know that there is always a scale larger than what you see. Every level and every role has value, and necessarily contributes to the whole.

# Self Improvement/Career Planning

## Have a self-feedback loop

Get to know what you are specifically good at, and what you need improvement on

## Make the effort to know the skills and drawbacks of every single person you know

One of the most important traits is being able to determine what your peers do well (so you can learn from them) and what they do poorly (so you can make sure you don't do that either)

## Have an future goal in mind

The question "Where do you see yourself in 5 years" seems cliche, but the whole point of it is to make sure you are working towards something. You're not supposed to be particuarly specific, but to at least have a target for you to hit.

* Do you just want to grow in your current position, be promoted from Senior to Staff? Do you have goals to be in people management?
* Do you want to pivot from software develpment? Would you want to switch from raw coding do project or product management?
* Do you want to pivot domains? Do you want to leave finance tech, and move into consumer electronics?
* Do you want to pivot stacks? Would you rather be doing serverside work over client side? Would you want to do SRE work? Data science?

## Always build your career towards these goals

The point of the exercise is to make sure any career change you have directly contributes to your future goals
